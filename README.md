# CS333 Project
Course project for CS333 Graduate Computer Networking at UChicago, Fall 2021.
This repository includes files for simulating a simple quantum network with continuous entanglement generation.
The main simulation loop may be executed via the `main.py` file, which also specifies simulation parameters.
The `graphing` directory contains tools for displaying data obtained for the project.
